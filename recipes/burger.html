    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>two pounds of ground beef</li>
      <li>two eggs</li>
      <li>four brioche hamburger buns</li>
      <li>six ounces of Monterey jack cheese</li>
      <li>one large tomato</li>
      <li>one large onion, four large leaves of lettuce</li>
      <li>butter</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>
        add all of the ground beef into a large bowl. Use a large wooden spoon
        to break up all of the ground beef, and then add in the eggs
      </li>
      <li>
        You'll want to mix in the eggs until they're fully incorporated to bring
        the ground beef mixture together.
      </li>
      <li>
        "The eggs help to bind the beef and will keep your burgers held together
        while cooking," says Marshall. "There's no need to add seasoning to the
        mixture at this step. That will come just before grilling."
      </li>
      <li>
        irst, divide up the ground beef mixture into four even portions, and
        then roll each section into a ball.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add chunks of the cheese into the middle of the patty, and then work the
        meat to cover the cheese.
      </li>
      <li>
        You'll want to remove the skin from the onion and slice it into thick
        slices. Slice the tomato into thick slices to use as a topping for your
        burger. Break up the leaf lettuce if needed. Use this time to mix
        together the mayonnaise and Dijon mustard in a small bowl.
      </li>
      <li>
        Before you're ready to grill for Gordon Ramsay's burger recipe with a
        twist, turn your grill on high to allow it to fully heat up.
      </li>
      <li>Lastly, add another small dollop of the mayo-mustard mixture.</li>
      <li>
        Brush the butter over top of each burger to add an additional layer of
        flavor. Generously baste each side to fully coat them.
      </li>
    </ol>
