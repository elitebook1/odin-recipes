    <h1>Easy lasagna recipe</h1>
    <img src="../images/lasagna.jpeg" alt="lasagna" />
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p1> Great tasting lasagna,that is easy to make. </p1>
    <p2>
      You can make any stage of the lasagna a day in advance, or make the
      lasagna and refrigerate overnight before cooking - the flavours will only
      develop more the longer you leave it.
    </p2>
    <p3>
      The longer you leave the ragu to simmer the better it will taste. Aim for
      3 hours if you have time.
    </p3>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>2 tbsp olive oil</li>
      <li>1 onion</li>
      <li>1 carrot</li>
      <li>1 stick of celery</li>
      <li>750g beef mince</li>
      <li>130g pancetta</li>
      <li>2 cloves of garlic</li>
      <li>1 beef stock cube</li>
      <li>1 sprig of rosemary</li>
      <li>1 glass white wine</li>
      <li>1 can chopped tomatoes</li>
      <li>2 tbsp tomato puree</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>
        For the ragu: Heat the oil in a large pan and then add the vegetables
        and leave to fry for 5 minutes until softened and beginning to colour.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the mince and pancetta and fry for a minute or two then add the
        garlic, stock and rosemary and cook until the meat has browned on all
        sides.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the white wine and simmer until slightly reduced before adding the
        tomatoes and tomato puree.
      </li>
      <li>
        Leave to simmer either on a low heat on the hob or in a preheated over
        at 160C for at least 1.5-2 hours.
      </li>
      <li>
        For the béchamel: heat the milk and bay leaf until it begins to simmer
        and then remove from the heat and set aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        In a separate pan, melt the butter over a medium heat and then add the
        flour to make a roux then add the milk (slowly at first) whilst stirring
        constantly.
      </li>
      <li>
        When you've added all of the milk, continue to stir over heat for about
        15 minutes until the sauce becomes really thick.
      </li>
      <li>
        Remove the bay leaf, season with black pepper and grate in the nutmeg to
        taste - I like to give it a really good grating.
      </li>
      <li>
        Mix in the egg yolks, then parmesan and remove from the heat and allow
        to cool.
      </li>
      <li>
        For the layers Grease a square baking dish (mine was 26x26cm) and add
        two sheets of lasagna.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cover the lasagna with a layer of ragu and then cover that with a layer
        of béchamel.
      </li>
      <li>
        Repeat the process until you're out of ragu. If you've got the
        thicknesses right then you should have enough for 4 decent layers.
      </li>
      <li>
        Top with a final layer of pasta, béchamel and then sprinkle over the
        remaining cheese.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake in a fan oven at 160C for 45-55 minutes until the cheese is
        bubbling and golden brown
      </li>
    </ol>
